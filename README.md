# Context
This is the first of a series of four projects aimed at automating search and data collection tasks related to my city's business & travel agency. This initial work sets out to create a basis for addressing web scraping techniques at the professional level. Although Scrapy is almost always the favorite, bs4 has made my job much easier, since it has a way of managing XML information that is normally clear and easy to handle.
